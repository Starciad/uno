This project was developed as a way to study and practice the C language, focusing on **modularization, coding best practices, code structure, and game logic**. The goal was to create a **challenging, fun, and faithful** experience based on the official UNO rules.

## About the UNO Game

**UNO** is an American card game created by **Merle Robbins and family** in **1971**. Over the years, it has become one of the **most popular card games worldwide**, with various themed editions and rule variations.

### **Quick Facts**

- **Number of players**: 2 – 10  
- **Number of cards**: 108  
- **Average playtime**: 15 – 30 minutes  

### **Rules Used**

- The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards.

- Each player starts with **7 cards**, and a card from the top of the deck is flipped to start the **discard pile**. During the game, players must **play a card that matches the top card** of the discard pile by **number, color, or type**. If they cannot play, they must **draw a card**.

- The deck includes **number cards (0–9)** and **special action cards**, as shown in the table below:

| Card            | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Skip**       | The next player **loses their turn**. |
| **Reverse**    | **Reverses** the turn order. |
| **Draw Two (+2)** | The next player **draws 2 cards** and loses their turn. |
| **Wild**       | Allows the player to **choose a new color**. |
| **Wild Draw Four (+4)** | Allows the player to **choose a new color**, forces the next player to **draw 4 cards**, and lose their turn. |

- If a player has only **one card left**, they must declare "**UNO!**". If caught not saying it, they must **draw 2 penalty cards**. The game continues until one player has no cards left.

- When a player draws a card, his turn is passed.
